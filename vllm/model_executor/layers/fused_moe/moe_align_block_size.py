# csrc/libtorch_stable/moe/moe_align_sum_kernels.cu takes its single-kernel
# "small batch expert" path only when topk_ids.numel() < 1024 AND
# num_experts <= 64. Qwen3.8-Flash-Next has 512 routed experts, so every call
# goes down the two-kernel path, and its second kernel
# (count_and_sort_expert_tokens_kernel) computes each token's slot with
#
#     rank_post_pad = atomicAdd(&cumsum_buffer[expert_id], 1);
#
# i.e. the order of tokens inside an expert segment is whatever order the
# threads happened to arrive in. The fused Marlin MoE's per-expert
# accumulation follows that order, so two identical calls differ in the low
# bits. This path ranks by ascending flat routed-row index instead.
#
# There is no other deterministic option in this tree: there is no
# moe_align_block_size_triton and no upstream determinism flag.

    Writes the same three (four with scatter_idx) out-params with the same
    conventions as the CUDA op:

    * ``sorted_token_ids`` is pre-filled with ``topk_ids.numel()`` (the
      padding sentinel) and then, for each valid routed row i, holds i at
      ``cumsum[expert(i)] + rank(i)`` where ``cumsum`` is the exclusive
      prefix sum of ``ceil(count[e] / block_size) * block_size``.
    * ``rank(i)`` here is i's position among that expert's rows ordered by
      ascending i -- this is the whole change.
    * ``expert_ids[b]`` is the (local) expert owning block b, -1 past the end.
    * ``num_tokens_post_pad`` is ``cumsum[num_experts]``.
    * ``scatter_idx[i]`` is i for valid routes and -1 otherwise.

    Every step is order-independent: ``bincount`` sums +1 integer atomics
    (commutative), ``cumsum`` is a fixed-order scan, and ``argsort(stable)``
    is a radix sort with a defined tie order.

    Shapes are static and nothing is read back to the host -- no ``.item()``,
    no boolean-mask indexing, and no op that sizes an output from device data
    (which rules out ``torch.bincount``) -- so the path stays CUDA-graph
    capturable, which the decode path requires.

    Note: In the case of expert_parallel, moe_align_block_size initially
    considers all experts as valid and aligns all tokens appropriately.
    Before the function returns it marks the experts_ids that are not in
    the current GPU rank as -1 so the MoE matmuls could skip those blocks.
    This requires the num_experts input arg to be the num global experts.

    Args:
        topk_ids: A tensor of shape [total_tokens, top_k] representing the
            top-k expert indices for each token.
        block_size: The block size used in block matrix multiplication.
        num_experts: The total number of experts.
        expert_map: A tensor of shape [num_experts] that maps the expert index
            from the global space to the local index space of the current
            expert parallel shard. If the expert is not in the current expert
            parallel shard, the mapping is set to -1.
        pad_sorted_ids: A flag indicating whether the sorted_token_ids length
            should be padded to a multiple of block_size,
        ignore_invalid_experts: A flag indicating whether to ignore invalid
            experts. When False, all expert_ids in topk_ids will participate in
            counting and ranking, but invalid experts in expert_ids will be marked
            as -1. When True, all invalid expert_ids in topk_ids will be ignored
            and will not participate in counting or ranking, and there will be no
            -1 in expert_ids.

    Returns:
    - sorted_token_ids: A tensor containing the sorted token indices according
        to their allocated expert.
    - expert_ids: A tensor indicating the assigned expert index for each block.
    - num_tokens_post_padded: The total number of tokens after padding,
        ensuring divisibility by block_size.

    This function pads the number of tokens that each expert needs to process
    so that it is divisible by block_size.
    Padding ensures that during block matrix multiplication, the dimensions
    align correctly.

    Example:
    Given topk_ids = [[2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 4], [1, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3]],
    block_size = 4, and num_experts = 4:
    - We initially have 12 tokens (after repeating 'top_k' times) and 4 experts,
        with each expert needing to process 3 tokens.
    - As block_size is 4, we pad 1 token for each expert.
    - First, flatten topk_ids to [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3].
    - Then append padding tokens [12, 12, 12, 12] for each block.
    - After sorting by expert index, we obtain token_ids
        [3, 6, 9, 12, 0, 4, 10, 12, 1, 7, 11, 12, 2, 5, 8, 12].
        Tokens 12 are non-existent (padding) and are ignored in
        the subsequent matrix multiplication.
    - The padding ensures that the total number of tokens is now divisible
        by block_size for proper block matrix operations.
